# breath-first-algorithm
to find shortest path between points in a binary grid where valued 1 grid is a path and 0 grid can't be travelled

first code file gives tthe shortest distance between any two nodes 

second code file gives you the shortest possible path from 1st row to last row, you can slightly change this code file to find shortest path between any rows
